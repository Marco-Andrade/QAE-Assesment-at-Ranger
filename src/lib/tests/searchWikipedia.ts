/**
 * This test was generated using Ranger's test recording tool. The test is supposed to:
 * 1. Navigate to Wikipedia
 * 2. Go to the "Artificial intelligence" page
 * 3. Click "View history"
 * 4. Assert that the latest edit was made by the user "Worstbull"
 *
 * Instructions:
 * - Run the test and ensure it performs all steps described above
 * - Add assertions to the test to ensure it validates the expected
 *   behavior:
 *   - If the latest edit was not made by "Worstbull" update the steps above accordingly
 *   - Write your assertion to provide clear diagnostic feedback if it fails
 *
 * Good luck!
